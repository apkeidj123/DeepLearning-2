Deep learning Model: Deep Neural Network

1. Classification
* Implement a DNN model for multi-class classification using Data.csv. The objective in this exercise is to create and train a neural network to identify Activities Types automatically. Split the data into training (80%) and validation (20%) data.
* Construct a DNN for multi-class classification according to the cross-entropy error function
* For each class, please record precision, recall and F1-score as well as the averages of those criteria (micro-average that will compute the metric independently for each class and then take the average and macro-average that will will aggregate the contributions of all classes to compute the average metric) over all classes

* Compare with different optimizers (Gradient descent, Ada-grad)

* Visualize the validation set through PCA and plot the data using 2 principal components.

* Project the validation set onto a 2D space by t-SNE.
